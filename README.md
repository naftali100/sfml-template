# sfml-template

cross platform sfml project template with a lot of stuff built in for easy and quick start.

WIP.

# how to use

- add new state that inherits from State class.
  
  ```cpp
  class MyState: public State {
  public:
    using State::State
    // override State's pure methods
  private:
    // all what the state need
    sf::Sprite m_player;
  };
  ```
- set the entry state in game class before the game loop.
- compile and run.

# what's in

- states
- animation (using texture atlas)
- easy resource management
- particle system (not the most efficient)
- tile map
- advance camera (with movements, zoom and adjustments to window resize in various ways)
- logging with plog, integrate sfml with plog
- sfml utilities
- imgui
- easy testing
- gui - WIP

# todo

- quad tree.
- update particle system to use VertexArray and batch rendering (or keep it with drawable?)
- states factories. (?)
